# Fitness-Tracker

## Description 

This is a Fitness-Tracker application that I'm creating. Basically, it gives the user the possibility create and track daily workouts.

Thus, the user will be able to create  a specific workout such as cardio or resistance. Therefore, he or she will be able to track exercise type, exercise name, weight, sets, reps, duration. Therefore, the user will be able to track his progress and will have great result. Because when someone is able to track his progress, he will be more motivated and the success will come faster.

## OBJECTIVES

The motivation that pushed me to realize this project is because I wanted to solve a problem in society. Nowadays, many people are getting fat because of lack of exercise. Many people must do exercise, stay active to be healthy. Therefore this application will help and motivate people to stay active, since the will be able to track their progress daily.


## Languages used

In order to get to this result, I have use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and mongoDB,and Heroku. First of all, we can think about HTML as a body. it stands for Hypertext Markup Language. Basically, it is a language that we can use to create web pages. Thus every single on internet is written using HTML. Moreover, it includes elements on the pages, images on the pages, the orders of the appearance of elements and so on. Secondly, we have CSS that stands for Cascading Style Sheet. It is used to make our website beautiful. It's used to define the cell padding of table cells, the style, the thickness, and color of a table's border, and the padding around images or other objects. The third most important element to point out is JavaScript. It is a pragramming language like Java, PHP, Python, C++. It's considered as the brain in human body. It allows us to implement complex features on web pages, animated graphics, interactive maps and so on.  It's with JavaScript that we have succeded to make this project work.
Also we create API. Api is needed to create mobile application. MongoDB is a nosql database. It uses a documented-oriented model as opposed to a table-based relational model. MongoDB stores data in BSON format.
For this project, the application will be run on heroku. Heroku is a cloud platform as a service supporting several programming languages.  

## Challenges met

There was many challenges during the realization of this project. The big obstacle was how to use deploy to Heroku
